"Open" is a bit of a buzz-word at the moment: open source, open access, open data, open science...but I agree with the fundamental idea of openness. I think it encourages efficient use of money and researcher time (less duplication), and a more equal scientific community (as some scientists do not have the resources to go to conferences or pay for journal subscriptions). I also think it could benefit me personally as a researcher (see ["How open science helps researchers succeed"](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554%2FeLife.16800)).

So one of my targets is to work more openly: to make my [papers](https://lucydot.github.io/publications), [software code](https://github.com/lucydot/), [slides](https://lucydot.github.io/slides) and [funding applications](https://lucydot.github.io/applications) available. I'm still learning about what "working openly" means, this is a work in progress!
