I am a computational scientist and a significant part of my time is spent writing code. Some of this code helps me to submit and manage my calculations which run on various supercomputers (primarily [Archer, the UK national supercomputer](http://www.archer.ac.uk/)). The rest of the code I write is used to analyse and extract meaning from the output from these calculations (numbers --> physics). 

Python and Bash are my go-to languages. Like many scientists, I am a self-taught programmer and have had very little in the way of training. The two things which have had the highest impact on the quality of code I write are: 1) teaching basic programming skills ([Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/)) to other researchers; 2) submitting a package to the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), a peer-reviewed journal for research code.

The package I submitted for peer-review is called `effmass`  and it is my first Python package with all the bells and whistles. It calculates the effective mass of electrons in a semiconductor, using a variety of definitions taken from solid state physics circa 1950. The bells and whistles were an enjoyable learning curve including documentation, testing and continuous integration.

My research would be made much more difficult if it were not for people sharing their code through websites such as Github. A big shout out to the open source community!
