My name is Lucy Whalley and I am a PhD student researching the electronic structure of solar cell materials in the [Walsh Materials Design](http://wmd-group.github.io/) group at Imperial College London. [My research](http://lucydot.github.io/blog/research/) uses solid-state physics and supercomputers to investigate why particular materials can efficiently convert sunlight into electrical energy.  Before my PhD I trained as a mathematics teacher, and I have worked as a teacher in a variety of settings - prisons, primary schools and cafes. I am [currently teaching](http://lucydot.github.io/blog/teaching/) basic programming skills to researchers at Imperial College London.

If you'd like the nuts and bolts, please [download my CV](../LW_resume.pdf).

This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a tweaked version of the [code editor](https://github.com/aubm/hugo-code-editor-theme/) theme.
