Hello, and welcome to my home on the internet. It's an empty home at the moment, but furnishings in the form of blog posts are planned for the future.

*For now, the basics:*

I am a PhD student in the [Walsh Materials Design](http://wmd-group.github.io/) group at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I am interested in developing materials for solar cells using computational modelling.

My funding is through the [Centre for Doctoral Training in New and Sustainable Photovoltaics](http://www.cdt-pv.org/).

My education, employment and publication history can be found via [Orcid](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2992-9871). My code can be found at [Github](http://github.com/lucydot).
